Currently: Postdoc @ [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) with [CCI](https://cci.mit.edu/) and [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)

Previously: PhD @ [UCSD](https://www.ucsd.edu/) with [HXI](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/) and [DesignLab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/)

Iâ€™m currently working on the design, development, and evaluation of systems that augment how humans creatively solve problems.

You can check out my [links](/links) and [publications](/publications) to see what I've been up to, or look at my [full CV here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MI95BTCKSKNYh1-BvJurPmgLtOsfU3vx/view?usp=sharing).

My work generally spans the fields of human-computer interaction, applied AI, and design. I am especially excited about the emergent capabilities of human-computer teams.
