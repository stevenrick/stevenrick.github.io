## Overview

- I was hired as one of the first two designers to be embedded within the product development group at [CliniComp Inc.](https://clinicomp.com).
- I was tasked with redesigning and modernizing the Perinatal Fetal Remote Monitoring Display (FMRD) in the Essentris suite.
- I worked across engineering, marketing, and the C-suite to design mockups, build iterative prototypes, and launch the redesigned product.

## Outcomes

- In 6 months we completely redesigned the Perinatal FRMD from the ground up. It is shown here.

## Details

- Before begining any redesign work, it was critical to get oriented around FMRDs by looking at both the current product and run competitive analysis of other products on the market from companies like McKessen, Cerner, and Philips.
- After completing the competitive analysis, we met with and interviewed the engineering lead, head of marketing, and several perinatal nurses to collect stakeholder needs.
- Several product needs were surfaced, including engineering's need to move to a responsive web tech stack that could scale from large displays down to mobile tablets easily. Marketing and the CEO also wanted to establish stronger branding with their product.
- From the practioner side, nurses needed a glanceable interface that could quickly tell them the state of their patients and the system sensors, and alert them to anything troubling related to heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, or device disconnection.

## Artifacts

- We explored many iterations of design in order to test a lot of assumptions about usability and glanceability. Along the way we surfaced additional needs related to custom alarm configuration, mitigating alert fatigue, and supporting data annotation on top of real-time traces.
